                        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                        printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
                        only five centuries,</p>
                    <p class="text-para">but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
                        Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                        including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                    <p class="text-para">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
                        roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
                        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
                        the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the
                        cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
                        from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and
                        Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
                        during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes
                        from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
